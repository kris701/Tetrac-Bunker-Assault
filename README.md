# Tetrac Bunker Assault
This was a rather large map design project that i made for the game Garrys Mod. As you may know, i have something for making bunker maps, and this is no exception. My other bunker maps however was fairly "static", where nothing really was going on. So i set out to make my most advanced map to date!
This map is a Combine Onslaught map, where you and a bunch of rebels defend an old soviet bunker from the combines. There are several many advanced concepts to this, such as special units, armor, support units, events, fire light etc.
This is the map i am most proud of, since i put a *LOT* of time into it, so please feel free to try it if you want! ^^
